/**
 This view modifier can be used to set a keyboard appearance
 of a `TextField` or `TextEditor`, which controls if it will
 use a light or dark color scheme.

 Although this modifier is named like ``KeyboardAppearance``,
 it has nothing to do with keyboard styling, but rather aims
 to use the same name conventions as the `keyboardAppearance`
 properties of `UITextView` and `UITextField`.

 You can apply the modifier with `.keyboardAppearance(.dark)`
 to apply a dark keyboard appearance. Note that you must set
 `foregroundColor` before the modifier, if you want to use a
 custom text field/editor text color.
