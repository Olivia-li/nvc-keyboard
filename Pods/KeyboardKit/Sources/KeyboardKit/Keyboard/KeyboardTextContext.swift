 This class provides keyboard extensions with contextual and
 observable information about the text in the document proxy.

 KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class
 and binds the created instance to the keyboard controller's
 ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardTextContext``.

 You can get this information directly from the proxy, using
 either the controller or the ``KeyboardContext`` to get the
 proxy instance, but the controller will continously sync it
 from the proxy to the context to let you observe it as well.

     to read the full document context, so have a look at it
