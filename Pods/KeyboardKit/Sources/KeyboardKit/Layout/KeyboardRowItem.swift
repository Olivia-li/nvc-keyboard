/**
 This protocol can be implemented by types that represent an
 item in a kind of row, such as input sets, layout items etc.

 The reason for having this protocol is mainly to have a way
 to share functionality. It is implemented by ``InputSetItem``
 and ``KeyboardLayoutItem`` and provide collection extension
 functions in `KeyboardRowItem+Collection`.
 
 The reason to why not using `Identifiable` instead, is that
 the row ID may not be unique. The same item may appear many
 times in the same row.
