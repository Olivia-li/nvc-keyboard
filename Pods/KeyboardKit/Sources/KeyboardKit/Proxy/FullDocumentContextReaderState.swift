 This static class is used as `UITextDocumentProxy` state in
 KeyboardKit Pro, when reading the full document context.

 This class is defined in the core library to make the input
 controller able to check if a proxy is currently performing
 a read operation, although the functionality is implemented
 in KeyboardKit Pro.
