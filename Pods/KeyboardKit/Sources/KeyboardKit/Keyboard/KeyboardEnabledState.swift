/**
 This observable class can be used to observe the state of a
 keyboard extension.

 This type lets you check if a keyboard extension is enabled
 (in System Settings), if it is active (currently being used
 to type) and if it has been given full access.

 Note that you can use bundle id wildcards, which means that
 you can inspect multiple keyboards with a single id.

 This class implements ``KeyboardEnabledStateInspector`` and
 syncs a ``isKeyboardEnabled`` and ``isKeyboardActive`` with
 the state of a provided keyboard `bundleId`. The properties
 are published and can automatically update any SwiftUI view.

       - bundleId: The bundle ID of the keyboard extension.
