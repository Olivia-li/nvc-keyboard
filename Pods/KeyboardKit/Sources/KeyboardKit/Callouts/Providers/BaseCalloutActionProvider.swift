/**
 This base class provides functionality to simplify creating
 a callout action provider.
 
 You can inherit this class and override any open properties
 and functions to customize the callout actions. The easiest
 way is to override `calloutActionString(for:)` and return a
 string that is then split and mapped to keyboard actions by
 `calloutActions(for:)`.
 
 ``EnglishCalloutActionProvider`` uses this logic to specify
 which actions to use for basic English.

     You can override this function if you want to customize
     the string that by default will be split into a list of
     ``KeyboardAction``s by `calloutActions(for:)`.

     Note that you must override `calloutActions(for:)` when
     these actions must support multuple multiple characters,
     e.g. for `kr` currencies, or when you want to use other
     action types than just characters.
