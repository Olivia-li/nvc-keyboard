/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to give autocomplete suggestions as the user types.
 
 The key function when using an autocomplete provider is the
 ``autocompleteSuggestions(for:completion:)``, which returns
 suggestions based on the provided text.
 
 KeyboardKit doesn't have an autocomplete provider as it has
 for most other services. It will instead create and setup a
 ``DisabledAutocompleteProvider`` that serves as a temporary
 placeholder service until you inject your own or register a
 KeyboardKit Pro license.
 
 KeyboardKit Pro unlocks two autocomplete providers when you
 register a valid license. The `StandardAutocompleteProvider`
 is locale-specific and non-predictive, and is injected when
 you register a license. `ExternalAutocompleteProvider` is a
 base class that can be inherited to communicate with an api.
 
 If you don't have a Pro license, you can implement a custom
 autocomplete provider in any way you like. When you're done,
 just replace the controller service with the implementation
 to make the library use it instead.
