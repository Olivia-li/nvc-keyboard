 This enum contains various haptic feedback types.
  
 You can call ``trigger()`` on any feedback value to trigger
 it, using the static ``engine``. You can replace the engine
 with any custom engine if you need to.

 Note that `macOS`, `tvOS` and `watchOS` resolves a disabled
 ``HapticFeedbackEngine`` by default, since the platforms do
 not support system haptics. You can replace it with another
 engine that does something meaningful on each platform.
