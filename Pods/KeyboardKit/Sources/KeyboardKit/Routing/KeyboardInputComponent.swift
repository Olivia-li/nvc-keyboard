 This protocol can be used to create text inputs that can be
 used within a keyboard extension.

 A view that inherits this protocol can use its functions to
 easily register and unregister itself as the keyboard proxy
 when it receives and loses focus.

 `UIKit` views that implement this protocol, which makes the
 views automatically become the text destination when a user
 taps them to start inserting text.
