## About KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit is a Swift library that helps you build custom keyboards with Swift and SwiftUI. It extends the native keyboard APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality than is otherwise available.

The end result can look something like this...or entirely different:

</p>

KeyboardKit lets you create keyboards that mimic the iOS stock keyboard in a single line of code. These keyboards can be customized to great extent to change their input keys, keyboard layout, design, behavior etc.

You can also use entirely custom views with the rich features of KeyboardKit, to create completely custom keyboard extensions. Most of the KeyboardKit features can be used on all major Apple platforms as well. 



## Supported Platforms

KeyboardKit supports `iOS 13`, `macOS 11`, `tvOS 13` and `watchOS 6`.
