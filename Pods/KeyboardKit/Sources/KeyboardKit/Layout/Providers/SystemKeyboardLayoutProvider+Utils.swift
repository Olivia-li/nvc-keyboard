/**
 These extensions are utils for the iPhone and iPad keyboard
 layout providers. They are temporary and should not be used
 when you subclass these classes, since I may remove them if
 they are no longer used, as I look for a better approach to
 dynamic layouts. These will be made internal in 6.0.

 Note that these properties just describe the input set, NOT
 the layout. For instance, Arabic uses 11-11-9, but does NOT
 share the same layout as LTR 11-11-9 keyboards.
